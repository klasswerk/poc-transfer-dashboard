/**
  * Event modelled after our data transfer system.
  *
  * Id, Partner, and Timestamp are standard.  Timestamp will be in ISO String format.
  *
  * The event is either a send or a receive.  Sync transfers have None for ackState and None
  * for receiptFor.  Async transfers have Some(AckPending) for ackState and None for receiptFor.
  *
  * Each async transfer needs a completing event in the opposite direction, i.e. an async send
  * needs a completing receive receipt and an async receive needs a completing send receipt.  The
  * receipts are the only events which have a Some(original_eventId) for receiptFor.
  *
  * For example:
  *
  * Sync send -> sendReceive of Send, ackState of None, receiptFor of None
  *
  * Async send -> sendReceive of Send, ackState of Some(AckPending), receiptFor of None
  * Completing Ack received -> sendReceive of Receive, ackState of None, receiptFor of Some(original_eventId)
  *
