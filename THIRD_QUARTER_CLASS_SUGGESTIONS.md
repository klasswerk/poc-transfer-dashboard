## Third Quarter Class Suggestions

Since the main assignment of the third quarter is the capstone project I think it
is important to keep the students focused on the project during the quarter.
For me it was too easy to loose focus and/or procrastinate during the quarter.

It's hard to say what the best solution would be.  Perhaps just like in software
development we could have had weekly check-ins.  The check-ins wouldn't have
to be too formal, but it would be good to demonstrate **something on the project**
each week.

I also think hearing about other projects, especially early on, would be
helpful.  Many of us used the same technologies --- JSON, Kafka, Cassandra,
etc.--- and I thought it was interesting to hear what libraries and
frameworks others were using and any issues or challenges others had encountered.
